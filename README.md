# SOWFA-setups

This repository contains input files for the Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications based on OpenFOAM-6 (https://github.com/NREL/SOWFA-6). Case studies are to be contained in subdirectories, which should contain all text input files needed to perform preprocessing and run the solver. Generated data (e.g., meshes) should _not_ be included.
