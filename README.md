# SOWFA-setups

This repository is an archive of Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) simulations successfully run within the A2e MMC project. Input files are for SOWFA-6 (https://github.com/NREL/SOWFA-6), which is based on OpenFOAM-6 (https://github.com/openfoam/openfoam-6). 

Case studies are to be contained in subdirectories, which should contain all text input files needed to perform preprocessing and run the solver. Generated data (e.g., meshes) should _not_ be included.
