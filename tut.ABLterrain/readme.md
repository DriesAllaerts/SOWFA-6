# Notes

to-do:
- allow different wind directions
- allow different stability states

notes:
- first script requests more cores than $nCores for RAM workaround for `moveDynamicMesh` call
- currently unrealistic uniform-inflow cyclic BC  case setup.
- 0.original/T has custom strong inversion boundary conditions
- terrain stl not included
