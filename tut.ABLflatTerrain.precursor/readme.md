# Instructions and general case notes

- For precursor runs, the BC are cyclic and the flowfield is initialized through `setFieldsABL`.
- At the end, run `foamOK` to quickly see if the runs were ok

# To-do

- Put (0,0) in the middle. Adjust terrainSlices accordingly
- Restarted runs may not work as currently is
